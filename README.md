# RealTime Game Server

# Instructions

To run the project locally, you should first have both _repositories_ cloned to your machine.

### [Client Side Repository](https://github.com/MoatazSaber/game-client)

### [Server Side Repository](https://github.com/MoatazSaber/game-server)

# The server should be started first **then** the client

To get the *server* on port 3000 and then the *client* would start on
[http://localhost:3001/?user-id=1](http://localhost:3001/?user-id=1)
and
[http://localhost:3001/?user-id=2](http://localhost:3001/?user-id=1)

npm i
